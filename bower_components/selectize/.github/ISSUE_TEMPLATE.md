Welcome to the Selectize bug tracker. Thank you for taking the time to
make Selectize a better library!

Please keep in mind this repository has an important issue backlog and
that maintainers have limited time to fix issues, triage, and understand
them.

If you've never done so, please read the
[guide to reporting issues](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/wiki/Reporting-issues-guide)
in the Wiki to help us better understand your issue. Here's the gist:

* Search for if your issue has already been submitted
* Make sure you're reporting something precise that needs to be fixed
* Give your issue a descriptive and concise title
* Create a *minimal* working example
* Indicate the steps to reproduce and result
* Use proper formatting, especially for code
* Help it be solved by finding the cause and proposing fixes

Thank you for reading this! You can now erase everything up to the
following dashes, and then complete what's after.
